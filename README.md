This repository is about the state of player development.

 I was thinking half a year ago:  Is there a way to implement a TVHeadend client for Tizen OS on Samsung TVs?

- HTSP C# Client - POC Rewritten work without worries maybe can rewrite for better performance
- Connection Protocol to Native Renderer - this was done by dynamic low latency buffer may be needed to improve stability starting flow
- DVBSUB Software Decoder and Renderer implemented with SkiaSharp Image processor

### Features

- Logging
- Live Playing
- Channel Browsing
